Grid & Collision:
	-The Tetris grid is divided into 16x10 blocks, in this design we will deal with blocks only.
	-For this we will need aux. procedures to check/draw the blocks for us.
	-We only care for the color of the block, if it's black then it is empty, if it is colored then it is not empty


Representation of the pieces:
	-We represent the pieces in a 4x4 grid, with values (colored) or (black), while moving this piece we can check
	if it is out of boundary or not, we can also check the collision, by iterating over the 16 blocks of this piece and check if
	any of the colored blocks collide.
	-We can also easily rotate the piece, by changing how we look at the 4x4 block
	eg: 00X0  rotated 90 degrees right will be	0000 (all we did is change X to Y and Y to X)
		0XX0									0XX0
		0X00									00XX
		0000									0000
	-We can have a procedure that takes the piece number (TYPE) and the piece orientation (ROTATION)
	and the (X,Y) of the block and returns if it is colored or not
